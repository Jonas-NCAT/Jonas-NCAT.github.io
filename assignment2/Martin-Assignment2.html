		<p> Learning HTML5 can be a worthwhile experience that provides context to our day to day web browsing, career growth opportunities, and the ability to create &amp; publish our very own websites. You begin to understand why webpages behave the way they do as well as why they look the way they look. HTML5 coupled with CSS allows you the ability to create and style your webpage in any fashion you see fit. The internet is never going out of style so there will be many career opportunites for future web developers &amp; designers. There are many free resources online that can get you started on your web design journey such as FreeCodeCamp, The Odin Project, and W3Schools.</p>
